Welcome to CYBERIA, my first-ever website and the start of my coding journey. I made this site around two years ago when I had never touched VS Code or written a single line of HTML or CSS. I followed YouTube tutorials, took lots of breaks to figure things out, and after about 46 hours of learning and experimenting, this little fashion site came to life.

The name CYBERIA was inspired by the cybercore y2k aesthetic — a bit edgy, a bit stylish, and a whole lot of internet vibe.

🛍️ What the Site Includes:

CYBERIA is a simple, static fashion-themed site with:

- A navigation bar linking to pages for clothing, shoes, and accessories

- A hero banner image to welcome visitors

- A short description and embedded video for added flair

- A contact section with a form

- A footer with a Pinterest link for style inspo

- All built with just HTML and CSS — no frameworks, no libraries, no shortcuts. It’s not perfect, but that’s what makes it special.

🌱 Why I’m Sharing This
This project isn’t just a website. It’s a reminder of where I started. Back then, centering text felt like magic, and getting a form to show up at all felt like a win. I’ve learned so much since then, but I keep CYBERIA up to celebrate how far I’ve come and to never forget the excitement of creating something from nothing.

🛠 Tech Used:

- HTML
  
- CSS

- YouTube tutorials and a lot of Googling

🌼 A Few Fun Notes:

- This was the first time I used a code editor

- I didn’t know what “padding” or “grid” meant yet

- I was so proud of the layout I screenshotted everything

- The background image? Picked purely for vibes

- It’s not about being flawless. It’s about being fearless when you’re new

Thanks for stopping by! This was just the beginning.
Now I build full-stack apps, contribute to hackathons, and work toward becoming a software engineer. But I’ll always look back at CYBERIA as the project that started it all 🤍🌐 CYBERIA: My First Website Ever
